/*
In Node.js, the concept of making an HTTP DELETE request involves using the built-in http or https modules or a more user-friendly library like axios or node-fetch to send a DELETE request to a remote server. The DELETE request is one of the standard HTTP methods used to request the removal of a resource on the server. It is typically used to delete a resource identified by a URL or URI.

Here's a basic example of how to make an HTTP DELETE request in Node.js using the http module:
*/

const http = require('http');

const options = {
    hostname: 'example.com', // Replace with the target server's hostname
    port: 80, // Replace with the appropriate port (80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS)
    path: '/resource-to-delete', // Replace with the path to the resource you want to delete
    method: 'DELETE', // Specify the HTTP method as DELETE
};

const req = http.request(options, (res) => {
    console.log(`Status Code: ${res.statusCode}`);
    res.on('data', (data) => {
        console.log(`Response Data: ${data}`);
    });
});

req.on('error', (error) => {
    console.error(`Request Error: ${error}`);
});

req.end(); // Send the DELETE request

/*
In this example:

We require the http module to create an HTTP request.

We define the options for the DELETE request, including the server's hostname, port, path to the resource, and the HTTP method (DELETE).

We create an HTTP request using http.request(), passing in the options.

We handle the response from the server, logging the status code and response data.

We handle any errors that may occur during the request.

Keep in mind that this is a basic example, and in a real-world application, you may want to handle errors, set appropriate headers, and potentially use a more feature-rich HTTP library like axios or node-fetch for better control and ease of use.

Here's an example using axios, a popular HTTP client library for Node.js:
*/

const axios = require('axios');

axios.delete('http://example.com/resource-to-delete')
    .then((response) => {
        console.log(`Status Code: ${response.status}`);
        console.log(`Response Data: ${response.data}`);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error(`Request Error: ${error.message}`);
    });

/*
This example simplifies the HTTP DELETE request handling and error management compared to using the http module directly.
