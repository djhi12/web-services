/*
In Node.js, you can create a web server to handle HTTP requests, including HTTP DELETE requests, and interact with a MongoDB database. Let's break down the concept into smaller parts:

Node.js: Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side. It's commonly used for building server-side applications, including web servers.

HTTP: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the internet. In the context of Node.js, you can use the built-in http module to create an HTTP server or use more advanced frameworks like Express.js to simplify the process.

HTTP DELETE Request: The HTTP DELETE request method is used to request that a resource be removed, typically on the server. It's commonly used for deleting data in a RESTful API.

MongoDB: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON). Node.js can be used to interact with MongoDB using the official MongoDB Node.js driver or other libraries like Mongoose, which provides a more structured way to work with MongoDB.

Now, let's put it all together by creating an example of handling an HTTP DELETE request to delete data from a MongoDB database using Node.js:
*/

// Import necessary modules
const http = require('http');
const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;

// MongoDB connection URL and database name
const mongoUrl = 'mongodb://localhost:27017';
const dbName = 'mydatabase';

// Create an HTTP server
const server = http.createServer(async (req, res) => {
    if (req.method === 'DELETE') {
        // Extract the resource identifier from the request (e.g., an ID in the URL)
        const resourceId = req.url.split('/').pop();

        // Connect to MongoDB
        const client = new MongoClient(mongoUrl, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });
        try {
            await client.connect();

            // Get a reference to the database
            const db = client.db(dbName);

            // Define the collection and delete the document based on the resource ID
            const collection = db.collection('mycollection');
            const result = await collection.deleteOne({ _id: new ObjectId(resourceId) });

            if (result.deletedCount === 1) {
                res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
                res.end('Resource deleted successfully.');
            } else {
                res.writeHead(404, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
                res.end('Resource not found.');
            }
        } catch (error) {
            res.writeHead(500, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
            res.end('Internal Server Error');
        } finally {
            // Close the MongoDB connection
            client.close();
        }
    } else {
        res.writeHead(405, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
        res.end('Method Not Allowed');
    }
});

// Start the HTTP server on port 3000
server.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:3000');
});

/*
In this example:

We create an HTTP server that listens for DELETE requests.

When a DELETE request is received, it extracts the resource identifier (e.g., an ID) from the request URL.

It then connects to the MongoDB database, deletes the document with the matching identifier, and sends an appropriate response back to the client.

This is a simplified example, and in a real-world application, you would likely have more error handling, security measures, and possibly use a framework like Express.js for routing and middleware handling.
