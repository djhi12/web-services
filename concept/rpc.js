/*
Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a concept in Node.js (and in distributed computing in general) that allows you to execute functions or procedures on a remote server or system, as if they were local function calls. It enables communication between different parts of a distributed application or between different systems over a network.

Here's how RPC works in the context of Node.js:

Client-Server Architecture: In an RPC setup, there are typically two components: the client and the server. The client initiates a request for a remote procedure, and the server executes that procedure and sends back the result.

Interface Definition: Before making RPC calls, you define an interface or API that specifies the available procedures and their parameters. This interface can be shared between the client and server, often using a common protocol like Protocol Buffers, JSON-RPC, or gRPC.

Client Calls: In Node.js, the client code makes a function call that appears to be local, but it's actually an RPC call. The client-side RPC library serializes the function call and its arguments into a format that can be transmitted over the network, typically as JSON or binary data.

Network Communication: The serialized request is sent over the network to the server. This can be done using HTTP, WebSocket, or other network protocols, depending on your RPC framework.

Server Receives and Processes: On the server side, a corresponding RPC library deserializes the request, identifies the requested procedure, and executes it. The server then serializes the result and sends it back to the client.

Client Receives Response: The client-side RPC library deserializes the response, making it available as the result of the remote procedure call. The client code can then continue executing based on the result.

Key points to note about RPC in Node.js:

Synchronous or Asynchronous: RPC calls can be synchronous, where the client waits for the server to complete the procedure and return the result, or asynchronous, where the client sends the request and continues with other tasks, later receiving the result through a callback or promise.

Error Handling: RPC systems handle errors that may occur during the remote procedure call, such as network failures or server errors. Proper error handling is essential for robust distributed systems.

Serialization: Data serialization and deserialization are crucial for converting function calls and their arguments into a format suitable for network transmission and back.

Security: Secure communication protocols and authentication mechanisms are important for protecting data and ensuring that only authorized clients can make RPC calls.

Popular Node.js libraries and frameworks for implementing RPC include gRPC, JSON-RPC, and libraries that build on top of them to provide more developer-friendly features.

In summary, RPC in Node.js is a mechanism for enabling communication between different parts of a distributed application, allowing functions to be called remotely as if they were local. It simplifies building distributed systems by abstracting away the complexities of network communication and serialization/deserialization.
